3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation
4. Ensure the test suite passes
5. Make sure your code lints
6. Issue that pull request!

## Styleguides

### Git Commit Messages

* Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
* Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
* Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
* Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line

### TypeScript Styleguide

* Use TypeScript for all new code
* Use proper type annotations
* Avoid `any` types when possible
* Use interfaces for object shapes
* Export types that are part of the public API

### CSS Styleguide

* Use kebab-case for class names
* Prefix component-specific classes with `pivot-`
* Keep specificity low
* Use CSS custom properties for themeable values

## Additional Notes

* `enhancement` - New feature or request
* `documentation` - Improvements or additions to documentation
* `good first issue` - Good for newcomers
* `help wanted` - Extra attention is needed
